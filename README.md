# FederatedUnlearnVerify

## Sources
Based on https://github.com/OngWinKent/Federated-Feature-Unlearning which implements Learning, Unlearning and Verification by using feature sensitivity, model inversion attacks and measuring accuracy on the retain dataset. In addition to that I have iplemented additional verification methods and have made changes to the original code by Win Kent Ong to make usage easier.
